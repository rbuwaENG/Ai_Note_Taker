This project utilizes speech recognition, natural language processing, and AI chatbot technology to create an AI assistant that can take notes and perform other tasks. The program runs on Python and utilizes the openAI GPT-3 language model. It has the following features:

- OpenAI chatbot: The program can engage in conversations with users and generate text based on the GPT-3 language model.
- Note-taking: Users can make notes by speaking to the AI assistant, and the notes are saved in a text file on the desktop.
- Continuous note-taking: Users can add more notes to the existing file by speaking to the AI, making it a convenient tool for taking notes during meetings or lectures.
- Screenshot capture: The AI can also take screenshots and save them on the desktop upon command.
- Customizable wake word: Users can set a wake word to activate the AI assistant, making it easier to use hands-free.
- Error handling: The program can handle exceptions and respond appropriately to user input.
- User-friendly interface: The program has a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to interact with the AI assistant.
